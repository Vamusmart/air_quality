# Responsive airQuality React app

I've recreate the design of a mockup put together by the UI team, and then I've use it in a React component that generates the PDF (using the pdf library ), with given props instead of fixed values, writing a test suite for the component. I've used functional style and hooks. The idea is to have at least a button that when pressed triggers the PDF generation using the props passed as input.

# Implementation

Knowledge of HTML and CSS and JS

# Description

Multi-level Form Submit using hooks api.
Form Input is shown at another level of form.
Form Validation by custom hook.
Submitted form data is shown in Table.
Generating PDF report for Submitted form data.

# Environment
